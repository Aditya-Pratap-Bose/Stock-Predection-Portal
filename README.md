This project is possible by [Rathan Kumar](https://www.youtube.com/@rathankumar), whose content made React-DRF auth simple and practical into my personal working flow.

> This project serves as a foundational base to practice full-stack skills. Advanced features like ML logic and deployment will be added incrementally.
